curie,"Do you mention the ""Bootlegger and Baptist"" theory often? Russ Roberts responds:","I don't think so. I used it in the book. It's a good example of the way that economics and social science and history have a lot in common. It's often said that the Bootlegger and Baptist theory is the attempt to justify what the politicians are doing. And I think it's the other way around. I think it's the politicians who justify what they want to do by appealing to the Bootlegger and Baptist theory. In a way, it's a way to make yourself feel good about what you're doing. And it's really hard to fight against it. It's hard to say, 'Well, I don't want to do this because it's bad for the poor. I think that's a really good argument. But most of us don't think that way. Most of us think, 'Well, it's not so bad on the poor. We'll take care of them. We'll give them a handout. We'll have a tax cut for them. We'll help them. We'll do this. And the politicians, of course, are aware of that. They appeal to that. And I think it's a very deep and powerful phenomenon."
curie,"As a proponent of free markets, are you attracted to the ""Bootlegger and Baptist"" theory? Russ Roberts responds:","Well, I'm not a big fan of the Bootlegger and Baptist theory, but I'm not sure it's a good theory either. I think the empirical evidence that--I'm not sure it's true. I think it's true that some people are more likely to give money to a politician that they think is going to help their own self-interested, ideological, ideological self. I think it's true that there are people out there who are crony capitalists. I think it's certainly true that there are people out there who are ideological, who are more likely to support politicians that are ideologically like them, and so on. I think there's some truth to the idea that some people are more likely to support politicians that are ideologically like them. And I think it's true that there are people out there who are crony capitalists. I think it's certainly true that there are people out there who are ideological, who are more likely to support politicians that are ideologically like them, and so on. I think there are real issues there. I'm not sure it's the right theory, but I think it's true."
curie,How skeptical are you of empirical research published in academic journals? Russ Roberts responds:,"I'm skeptical of most of it. I think there's some really good work that gets published in those journals. But I think there's a lot of work that's just not very good. I think the peer review process is very imperfect. I think that's true in economics as well as other fields. I think that's true in psychology as well; I think there's a lot of psychological research that gets published that is not of very much value. I find it a little bit of an insult to my intelligence to be honest. I can't imagine sitting in the armchair and feeling, 'Well, this was a good study, this was a bad study. I think a lot of the studies are flawed. I think it's very hard to tease out the true effect of a policy change in, say, a randomized control trial, that's where I think a lot of the work gets published. I think the sample is not large enough, I don't think the controls are good enough. I think there's a lot of mistakes in the analysis and the cherry picking of the data. I think it's a very imperfect science. I think the peer review process is not good. I think the journals are not good publications--except"
curie,"Do you believe that ""data can speak for itself"" as a general principle? Russ Roberts responds:","Well, I'm skeptical about that. I think the question is: Is it true? So, you know, the question is: Do we have enough evidence to demonstrate that one intervention works better than another? And I think we need to be honest about that. And I think we need to be honest about the fact that there are going to be biases in our data sets. We need to be careful about how we try to control for those. So, I have some--I'm a big fan of experimental economics. And I think experimental economics is very important. I don't think randomized control trials are the be-all and end-all. I think we need to be honest about the fact that what works in one place is not necessarily going to work in another place. So, I think there's a lot of issues that we've got to be honest about. I'm not a big fan of the phrase 'data can speak for itself. That's a phrase that sometimes comes up in the literature. And I understand the appeal of it. I think it's true--that if you have a large enough sample, you can make strong claims about the average impact of an intervention. But the phrase itself--I think it's over"

curie,"Why do you think Nassim Taleb's ""skin in the game"" is a deep thought? Russ Roberts responds:","Well, I don't know about that, but it's a nice thought. I think it goes back to the issue of self-interest versus public interest. The idea of living in a system where I'm not insulated from the consequences of my actions and I have to take a little bit of risk--it's a very deep idea that I think is very powerful. And I think it's very difficult to implement. I think it's a nice thought--but I don't know if it's a good idea. It's hard to know."
curie,"In what way does understanding the challenge around ""creating a prairie"" align with F A Hayek's famous maxim about the curious task of economics? Russ Roberts responds:","Well, I think there's a couple of lessons in there for us. I think the first is that a lot of what we think of as our knowledge, our understanding, is not just false but of limited use. So, when we think we have a grasp on some particular issue, we often are just fooling ourselves. And I think that's a very important lesson. I think the second lesson is that we have to be humble enough to realize that we don't have the answers, and we have to be open enough to realize that we may be wrong. And I think that's very important. But the third part of that is, I think, the most important part. And that is that we have to be willing to change our mind. And I think one of the hallmarks of a good economist is that you are open to that. I think most economists I know are very skeptical about their own knowledge and the knowledge of their colleagues. And I think that's a good thing. But I think the reason you have to be open to that is because the world changes. And what you thought was true yesterday may not be true today. And it's good to be open to that."
curie,"Why is it harder to ""create a prairie"" then it seems? Russ Roberts responds:","Well, that's a really interesting question. And, I think part of the answer is that it is harder to create a prairie. It's hard to convert grassland into prairie. It's not that hard to convert prairie into a field again. But, that's not what we're talking about here. The question is, why is it hard to create a prairie? Why is it hard to create a prairie that has a different--a different ecological function? And, I think the answer to that is that, as you said, it's not just the grasses and the prairie. It's the soil, it's the insects, it's the wildlife. It's a whole ecosystem that comes together to make a prairie. And, the fact that it's more complicated is really the reason that the prairie has survived for so long."
curie,"As a free market economist, why are you drawn to the idea of the ""Chesterton Fence""? Russ Roberts responds:","Well, there are two parts to that. One is that, as an economist, I'm skeptical of the ability of government to solve problems. So, I'm very much in favor of limited government. And the other part of that is that I'm skeptical of what I call 'redistribution. So, the idea that government would take money from one group of people and give it to another group of people is deeply, deeply troubling to me. So, the question is: How do we justify that? How do we justify the fact that we have a safety net? How do we justify that the government has the power to take money from people who are rich and give it to people who are poor? And I think the answer--it's a very good question, and I think the answer is that it's not just the poor who are poor. It's the rich too. It's the middle class. And they suffer the same challenges. And so, the idea that we would do that, I think, is immoral. It's a bad idea. And I think it's deeply immoral. So, that's the first part of the story. The second part of the story is that, as I said, I think the"
curie,Do macroeconomists have a sense of humor? Russ Roberts responds:,"Well, I'm an economist, so I have a sense of humor. But I'm not the only one. I'm not the only one. I think the profession is rather grim. I think we have a lot of good empirical work being done. I think we're much more aware of the data than we were a decade ago. I think we have a much better understanding of what's going on around the world. But I think the macro side of economics is still stuck in a time warp. We're still romanticizing the gold standard, interest rates, Say's Law. And we have a hard time understanding the role of monetary policy in the current environment. I think we have a long way to go."
curie,Who are some guests from EconTalk from the year 2014? Russ Roberts responds:,"Well, I think my favorite guest of the year is probably Jim Otteson, who is a professor at the University of Georgia. And, he and I have had a number of conversations on the EconTalk site, and he's a very interesting person. And, I think the other person I'd mention is my friend and co-host, Dave Feldman. Dave is a very interesting economist. We've had some conversations over the years, and he's a great guest. I think my guests from the year 2014 are Jim Otteson and Dave Feldman. Russ Roberts responds: I'm going to add one more. I'm going to add one more guest, which is Michael Munger. Michael Munger is a very, very, very smart person. He's a philosopher, but he also has a deep understanding of economics. And, our conversation on his book, What's So Great About Christianity, is a classic."
davinci,"Do you mention the ""Bootlegger and Baptist"" theory often? Russ Roberts responds:","I don't, no. It's an--I think it's an interesting idea. It's a way of trying to understand why certain things appeal to people who may not be directly interested in them. So, you might be in favor of banning liquor sales on Sunday because you are a good Methodist and you don't like the idea of other people drinking liquor. But you realize that that's not a very good argument. So you have to come up with some other reason. And so you say, 'Well, it's a safety issue. It's a safety issue for workers. But you don't really care about workers' safety. But you can use that as your justification. And so it's a way of allowing your pure self-interest to be disguised by some other motive that is more publicly acceptable. So, I think it's a really interesting idea. I don't know how much truth there is to it. Certainly, it's true that people sometimes vote for things that they know will benefit them personally, even though it's not in their self-interest to admit that."
davinci,"As a proponent of free markets, are you attracted to the ""Bootlegger and Baptist"" theory? Russ Roberts responds:","Yeah, that's a great way to think about it. I think that's very helpful. So, the basic idea of the Bootlegger and Baptist theory is that--it's a way of thinking about the political process. So, a Bootlegger is somebody who wants to profit from some kind of regulation. So, a Bootlegger is a nightclub owner who wants to profit from liquor prohibition. So, Bootlegger is a kind of a code word for somebody who wants to profit from some kind of regulation. A Baptist is somebody who wants to advocate for that regulation for some other reason. So, a Baptist might be somebody who wants to advocate for liquor prohibition because they want people to be virtuous. So, the Bootleggers and the Baptists both want prohibition. The Bootlegger wants it for self-interested reasons; the Baptist wants it for other-interested reasons. And the idea is that Bootlegger and Baptist are both active in politics. And Bootleggers tend to be more active because they have a direct incentive to influence the political process. And Baptists tend to be less active because it's not clear that they have an immediate, self-interested reason to be active in the political process."
davinci,"Russ, how skeptical are you of empirical research published in academic journals? Russ Roberts responds","Well, I'm very skeptical. I think--I'm going to get myself in trouble here. I think the incentives are all wrong. I think it's very difficult to do good empirical work. I think there are a lot of mistakes that are made over and over again. And I'm very skeptical of a lot of what gets published in academic journals. I think there's a lot of--the incentives are toward getting published and getting tenure and promotion. And I think that leads to a lot of bad research. It's not necessarily fraudulent--although there's some of that--but it's--a lot of times it's just--it's the wrong answers to the wrong questions. It's--I'm a fan of [John] Ioannou's work on this. It's--you know, the--if you want to make sure that someone is a good researcher, take them out of the university and put them on a desert island with nothing to do but research. And if they come back with a result, you'll know they're a fraud. You know, they've had nothing to do but think about this one thing. The--I think a lot of the problems in economics are that people with tenure and promotion"
davinci,"Russ, are you skeptical that ""data can speak for itself"" as a general principle? Russ Roberts responds:","I'm very skeptical. I think it's a lovely idea; it's very appealing. It's a very American idea, that the truth will prevail and the truth is the data. And it's very appealing to everyone because when the data goes your way, you can say, 'Look, the data showed it, so you can't deny it. And when the data doesn't go your way, you can say, look, the data is wrong. So, I'm deeply skeptical of that. I think that's a lovely phrase, but I don't think it's a very good guide. In particular, I think it's very--I have a phrase: 'Bad data, wrong conclusions. Because the data can be wrong. And the conclusions can be wrong. And it's very hard to know which is which."

davinci,"Russ, what do you think Nassim Taleb's idea of skin in the game? Russ Roberts responds:","Well, I think it's a very deep idea. I think it's a very deep idea for a lot of reasons. One of which is that it's very related to our conversation today about the value of information. Because what he is saying is that if you are in a position of giving advice or making decisions, you should have some of the consequences of those decisions. So, if you are an investment banker giving advice to a company about, say, an acquisition, you should have some of your own money at stake in that decision. If you are a policymaker making decisions about the future of the country, you should have some of your own wealth at stake. And so, I think that's a very deep idea. I think it's true. I think it's very--it's a very challenging idea. And I think it's very--it's a very powerful idea. Because, of course, it means that a lot of people who are making decisions don't have skin in the game. And that's very--that's a very bad thing."
davinci,"In what way does understanding the challenge around ""creating a prairie"" align with F A Hayek's famous maxim about the curious task of economics? Russ Roberts responds:","Well, Hayek's maxim is that ""the curious task of economics is to demonstrate to man how little he really knows about what he imagines he can design. And I think that is true of policy generally. Policy is a process of trying to orchestrate things that we don't understand very well. And prairie restoration is a good example of that. We don't understand how prairies come about. We don't understand the processes that created them in the past, so we don't really know how to recreate them. And so it's interesting to do it as an experiment. It's interesting to try to understand what's going on. But it's a very, very difficult challenge. And I think that's true of most policy. It's certainly true of macroeconomic policy. It's true of international policy. It's very, very hard to orchestrate things that we don't understand very well."
davinci,"Why is it harder to ""create a prairie"" then it seems? Russ Roberts responds:","Well, I think the biggest challenge is that it's a complex system. And, you know, we've talked a lot on this program about how economists tend to overuse the word 'system' and they tend to overuse the word 'complex. But, it's really hard to create a prairie, because prairies are very highly adapted to the climate and the soil and the particular species that are there. And, you can't just put the seeds in the ground and expect to get a prairie. They are a complex interaction of many different species of plants and animals that have evolved together. And, prairies are a classic example of what we now call an 'emergent system. And, an emergent system is one where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. And, prairie is a classic example of that. And, prairie is also a classic example of what we now call a 'complex adaptive system. And, complex adaptive systems, we've talked about on the program before with Nassim Taleb and others. But, complex adaptive systems are systems where the initial conditions are so important that you can't just start over. You can't just reset the system to the starting point and expect"
davinci,"As a free market economist, why are you drawn to the idea of the ""Chesterton Fence""? Russ Roberts responds:","Well, the Chesterton fence is a fence that doesn't do what it was intended to do, but it has an unintended consequence that's good. And the idea is that Chesterton is talking about someone who wants to fence off their field. And Chesterton says, 'Well, why do you want to do that? It's a good idea. It's a fence; it keeps the cows in. But what about the cows that are on the other side of the fence? They can't get in. So, Chesterton's point is that we need to sometimes look at the unintended consequences of our actions. And, the problem I have with most regulations is that the people who are harmed by those regulations are not the same as the people who are helped. And, it's very hard to see the benefits. If you look at a regulation, like the Dodd-Frank legislation that was passed in the United States, there are people who are helped by that legislation. There are people who are working in the industry who are benefiting from that legislation. But, there are a lot of other people who are hurt by it. And, it's hard to see the benefits. And, so, I'm a big fan of the idea that"
davinci,"You often say that economists have a sense of humor because they use decimal points, why is that? Russ Roberts responds:","Because we are deeply inadequate in our ability to understand the real world. And the decimal point gives us a sense that we are being precise when we really have no idea what we are talking about. The decimal point allows us to create the illusion of knowledge where there is only ignorance. And so, whenever I--we economists are very prone to say something like, 'Well, we have a sense of humor because we use decimal points. I don't have a sense of humor because I use decimal points. I have a sense of humor because I'm in a profession that is deeply inadequate to describe the world as it is. And so that's the joke. And I think the joke is on me. And I think the joke is on my profession. And I think that's a good thing. I think it's healthy to acknowledge that we are in some sense in the dark. We are groping. We are stumbling. We are making things up. We are using our intuition. We are using our experience. But we are not doing--it's not a science. It's not like physics. And I think it's healthy to be honest about that."

ada,"Do you mention the ""Bootlegger and Baptist"" theory often? Russ Roberts responds:","I do. And I think it's an interesting point. The Baptist view was that the invitation to the Baptist Church was to help the poor; to help the poor; to help the poor. And then when the Lord showed the way, they disappeared. The Bootleggers, who were the ""strong-minded sort, "" said: Well, no, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay. They can just go and help the poor. And they did. But then when the Lord showed the way, they didn't. And that's because they were not ready for it."
ada,"As a proponent of free markets, are you attracted to the ""Bootlegger and Baptist"" theory? Russ Roberts responds:","Well, bootleggers and Baptists have different things to do with it. But, I think a lot of people are attracted to it. But, I think a lot of people are attracted to other ideas. I think a lot of people are attracted to ""free markets"" as well. As you said earlier, you're not a free market person. But, that's not what we're talking about. What we're talking about is the policy implications of your book. You've written a lot here about the role of government. You've written about the welfare state, the welfare state as a form of protection for the wealthy. And, as a result, it's come under fire by many people, both from the left and from the right. But, there's an argument that the government has done a very poor job at helping poor people in places like China. What do you think of that criticism? I'm going to start by saying: I think the problem is that we've got a lot of people who are seeking to take that criticism to a different approach. So, one way to think about it is: What's your response to that criticism? Is it: Well, we don't have a very good welfare state. Maybe"
ada,Is Russ Roberts skeptical of empirical research published in academic journals?,"Yes. I think it's important to be skeptical of the published results of empirical work, and not just accept them as the result of randomized control trials, where we choose a group and then we test it in a way that we know of, but it's an experimental trial. So, I think, empirical work, especially in economics, it's very difficult in economics to take a side. And, I think it's a little bit of a race. It's a little bit of a tug of war. And, I think it's a little bit of a tug of war because there's this intellectual tug of war between the empirical study that's published in the journal of economics or in the academic journals--we don't know the truth about how this works, the empirical study--and then the rational choice economists, who then publish that result in the journal or in the academic journal. And, it's not just a tug of battle. It's a tug of war. And, as a result, I think it's an incredibly difficult thing to know. So, I'm not as skeptical as I might be of empirical work and I think it's a little bit of a tug of war. I think we have a very weak grasp of what's going"

I think it's good to be reminded. But I think the part that I think is really interesting, and I think this is the part that I want to talk about in a minute, is that the idea of something being a ""just a theory"" is like the idea of a theory of economics. In the old days, if you had a theory of economics, you had a theory of the market. You had a theory of what the rules of the game were. And you had a theory of the incentives that would arise from the incentives, and the incentives that would arise from the incentives, and the rules that would arise from the rules. And so, you'd have some kind of framework from which you could then identify what was a good theory, what wasn't a good theory, and maybe that one wasn't so good. "

And, as you point out, there's a lot of space for people to do something productive in the prairie.

I think that's a good idea. I think it's a good idea to think about the city as a set of buildings, not just as a set of buildings that are connected together. You have to think of a way to make it larger relative to the space that it would take up. There's a set of arguments for that, and I think they're good arguments. I think they're good arguments.

So, a street might be fenced off and people might have to go to a different part of the city for certain kinds of activities. And I think it's important to remember that--I've made this mistake a number of times on this program--I think it's important to remember that we all have different tastes. We all have different problems with our children. We all have different problems with our neighbors. And we all have different problems with our little corner of the city. And we all have different problems with our neighbors. And I think that's why there's some sense in which, if you want to live in a city, you have to be willing to share, to be willing to share space with people you don't like, to be willing to share things with people you don't like. And I think that's part of what makes the city attractive to the free market economist."

The other thing I want to mention, is that I think it's important to remember that the world is not a scientific problem. It's not a problem of degree of freedom or perfect competition. It's a problem of incentives and market failure. And so, when we talk about market failure, and if we're talking about the failure of the financial sector, or the failure of the housing sector to make the investments that we'd like to see made, the financial sector is not a reliable indicator of the rest of the economy."

It was on the air with Gary Becker. It was on the air with John Bates. It was on the air with John Bates and James Tobin. It was on the air with Adam Smith. It was on the air with Irving Fisher. And, I was very interested in the idea that EconTalk is going to be on the air again. And, I was very interested in the idea that it would be a different kind of conversation. So, I decided to go back and listen to the first two episodes of the first season of EconTalk."
babbage,"Do you mention the ""Bootlegger and Baptist"" theory often? Russ Roberts responds:","Yeah, it's a--I mean, that's a really interesting idea. I think it's a beautiful idea. And I've said it often here on the program. I'm a big fan of the big idea. And I think if we could understand the role that religion plays in our lives, we can improve the world. And I think we have a lot to learn. I think it's an incredibly important thing to do. I think it's an incredibly important thing to learn. And I'm not sure we're doing it effectively. We're not doing it effectively in the way that we should be doing it. But I do think it's a big, big part of our lives. I think the other big idea, the one that you focus on, which I think is really interesting, is the role of family. We think of family as something that we create--that we give ourselves to. But we really are in it for other reasons. For a lot of people, it's the family that they're in. They live with their parents. They live with their spouse. They have kids. They have a family. And I think that's a much more complicated thing than we have any idea of understanding it. And"
babbage,"As a proponent of free markets, are you attracted to the ""Bootlegger and Baptist"" theory? Russ Roberts responds:","Well, I think there are many people who are attracted to the Bootlegger and Baptist theory, for reasons that we've talked about before. And I think that's a great explanation for why there's so much religious activity in the United States. And I think it's a beautiful theory. I think it's true. But when I look at the world in which we live, I think what's true is that there's a lot of religious activity in the world, but it's not all religious activity. And I think it's important to think about what's going on. I think the religious activity that's going on, which is so much of it, is not religious activity of the sort that you're talking about. It's not a religious revival. It's not the Pentecostal phenomenon. It's not the Buddhist phenomenon. It's not the Hare Krishna phenomenon. It's not the Scientology phenomenon. It's just a lot of people coming together who have a desire to be close to God, who have a desire to be close to other people, and to have a community of people that they can be close to. And that's a wonderful thing. It's not a bad thing. It's not a"
babbage,How skeptical are you of empirical research published in academic journals? Russ Roberts responds:,"I think it's a little bit of a mixed bag. It's kind of a mixed bag. I think there is an empirical question whether it's reliable. But I don't think it's a large part of economics. I think the other thing I would add--and this is an interesting example, because I think it's true in many areas of life--I think it's true in many areas of life, it's not just a question of whether the facts are real: it's a question of whether they are useful. That's a different question. But in many areas of life, the facts are not so useful. And the other thing I would add is that if you are a journalist and you want to write a story that's going to get you some readers and clicks, you are going to do your best to make it a good story. And you do that by putting some facts in. And if you don't, you are in trouble. So, I don't think in economics we just make up our facts. But I do think it's true that in many areas of life we are so focused on the facts, we are so focused on the truth--which is the way we like to think of ourselves"
babbage,"Do you believe that ""data can speak for itself"" as a general principle? Russ Roberts responds:","My answer to that is: There's a lot of data in the world. And, I think there's a lot of things that--I think of it as a way to be skeptical about the data. I think the challenge is that, the data is complicated. It's not just, 'I saw a spike in unemployment and therefore the recession is over. It's not just, 'I saw a decline in inflation and therefore the economy has recovered. It's complicated. And, I think that's one of the things we're trying to understand. And, I think it's a very challenging thing to do. I'm a big fan of the idea that, 'Well, we don't know everything that we need to know. And, 'We don't know everything that we can know. And, that's okay. And, I think that's not just a philosophical thing. I think it's very practical. I think it's very practical for a number of reasons. But, I think, even more than that, the way I think about it is, it's very likely that there are things we don't know, and things that we don't know are things that we don't know we don't know"
babbage,"How would Russ Roberts finish the following sentence from Adam Smith: ""Man desires not only to be loved",", but to be lovely. "" Smith says, ""Man desires not only to be loved, but to be lovely. "" And that's what he means by 'love'--that we want to be loved, and be lovely."
babbage,"Finish the following sentence by FA Hayek: ""The curious task of economics",is to demonstrate to men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design. 
babbage,"Why do you think Nassim Taleb's ""skin in the game"" is a deep thought? Russ Roberts responds:","Well, I think it's because he's a very rationalist, and he's very skeptical of what he calls 'explanations, and so skin in the game is a very challenging concept to him. I think it's not clear what it means. It's a little bit like saying, 'skin in the game' means I'm responsible for the outcomes of my trades. Because if I'm going to make a trade, I want to see what's going to happen. And I assume if I make a stupid trade, I'm going to lose money. I don't want to see that. So I'm going to skin in the game. And if I see that the outcome is going to be good, I'm going to make a good trade. I'm going to skin in the game. If I see no good outcomes, no skin in the game, I'm going to skin in the game in the case of my stupid trade, too. So, skin in the game is a very deep, very deep idea. But I think what's fascinating about it is that even though it is not intuitive, it is not obvious--and it's not obvious to me--why skin in the game is a thought."
babbage,"In what way does understanding the challenge around ""creating a prairie"" align with F A Hayek's famous maxim about the curious task of economics? Russ Roberts responds:","Yeah, I like to quote Hayek. I think he's a fantastic writer. The point I wanted to emphasize is that, you know, I've tried to think about the prairie from the perspective of the academic. And I think that's a really interesting question. I think it's something we should think about--the question of the prairie. I think it's something we should think about, because it's something we're talking about that we should think about. And, it's not necessarily going to answer the question as to how to get there. But, I think it's a good question. It's a good question, because it's--it's something we should think about. And, it's a question of what to do with the data that we have. And, it's a question of how to make the case. And, I think it's interesting to think about the data. Obviously, we're not in the field. We're in the academic world. We're in the classroom. We're in the classroom with a bunch of topics that we're interested in. But, the prairie is not one of them. "
babbage,"Why is it harder to ""create a prairie"" then it seems? Russ Roberts responds:","Well, it's a little bit complicated. I think it's really hard to think about it in a way that's fruitful. And I think that's the challenge."
babbage,"As a free market economist, why are you drawn to the idea of the ""Chesterton Fence""? Russ Roberts responds:","The whole idea of the Chesterton fence is that you have to have a place where you can put your stuff that's temporary. And, you have to have some kind of gate so that people can come in and get their stuff out. And, there are two obvious things you could do. One is you could just have a fence, but you don't want to be in the business of keeping people out. You don't want to be in the business of keeping people in. And, you can make a case that a fence is better than no fence. But, it's not trivial to make that case. There's a lot of evidence for it. And, I think that's why Chesterton's fence is important. It's not just because he's a good poet. He's a good poet, but he also has a lot of other value."
babbage,"You often say that economists have a sense of humor because they use decimal points, why is that? Russ Roberts responds:","Well, that's because we're not as accurate as a barometer, which is also a decimal point. But, I think what we're talking about is a deeper issue. I think there's a bit of a--I'll use the decimal point as a little bit of a joke. I think we have a na•vety about the world. We're not really sure what we're talking about. The decimal point is a little joke in the real world. We have a tendency to think that if we have a certain number of things, we know what it is."
babbage,Who are some guests from EconTalk from the year 2014? Russ Roberts responds:,"I'm going to try to think of one, but I'm going to have to think. I think of one is--I think of Muni Viswanathan. He's the founder of the Indian e-commerce site Flipkart, which I love, and he's also the co-author of a book called The Second Machine Age."
